# Wether

Thats the title<br>
it's like "weather" but with "we" since everyone contributes... (change this)

# What and why

My idea is a crowdsourced weather app for what the weather is like in real time in your area.<br>
There can be questions like "Are there puddles?" or "Is there a lot of snow?", or even "Do you need allergy meds?"

Maybe my weather app says it's raining, but its actaully not where I am.<br>
Or maybe it snowed last night, and I want to know how much snow is on the ground to decide whether or not I need boots. (since the prediction can be off)<br>
Maybe I'm allergic to pollen (I am) and want to know when to start taking meds without having to suffer for the first day.<br>
Sometimes info more detailed than the forecast is nice

# For whom

People who want more info than what a normal weather app gives. This can be anyone who's planning to go outside and wants to be prepared. The app can also provide a normal weather forecast, so it can replace users' normal weather apps.

# How

Users can see the current weather and forecast like a normal weather app.<br>
There are also local details provided by other users.<br>
Users can submit their own answers to questions to contribute.<br>
Users can vote on the details shown to them if they're inaccurate.<br>
There is also a comments section for people nearby to comment on how it is outside.<br>
  - A possible comment could be: "There are a ton of angry bees near the tree on the corner, stay clear❗❗"

# Scope

There are enough parts to implement (comments section, collecting user submissions, etc.) that it shouldn't be too easy.<br>
The parts are all manageable so it shouldn't be too hard either.
